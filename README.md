This is the Python file that we have to run from the command line. To change the MAC address.

Open the terminal in the same directory where the file is placed, or navigate to that file location.

Then run the command **python3 mac_changer.py** and press enter.

The GUI will open, and then it has two buttons: one is mac_changer, which will generate a random mac value and change the MAC address of the eth0 interface in Linux.
